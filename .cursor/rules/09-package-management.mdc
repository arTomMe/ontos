### Package Management

- This project uses **Yarn** for frontend package management. Use `yarn add`, `yarn install`, `yarn remove`, etc., instead of `npm`.
- Upon deploying, Databricks Apps detects if `package.json` is present and calls `npm install`, `npm install -r requirements.txt` (if present), and `npm run build` in that case. This should build the static JavaScript content dynamically and there is no need to ship that explicitly.
