### Testing and Deployment

- Implement **unit tests** (e.g., using `pytest` for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend).
- Ensure proper input validation (Pydantic on backend, Zod/react-hook-form on frontend) and error handling.
- **Deployment**: Deployed as a Databricks App via `databricks bundle deploy` using `api/app.yaml`.
