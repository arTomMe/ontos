  # Data Contract Links to Business Concepts
  # Note: Customer Data Contract semantic links are now defined in the ODCS contract itself
  # via authoritativeDefinitions at contract, schema, and property levels

# Schema Property Links to Business Properties
# Note: Property-level semantic links are not currently implemented in the system.
# The semantic links system currently supports entity-level links only.
# This section is kept for future reference when property-level linking is implemented.

# Future enhancement: Link individual schema properties within contracts to business properties
# This would require extending the semantic links system to support property-level granularity
